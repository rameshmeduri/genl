- `You` drank my beer

- - -

#### Examples:

### Possessive Pronouns
- replace possessive nouns
- can be either the subject or object in a sentence
- are: `my`, `mine`, `his`, `her`, `hers`, `its`, `our`, `ours`, `your`, `yours`, `their`, `theirs`

#### Examples:

### Reflexive Pronouns
- are used in place of a person of thing that is both the `subject` and `object` of the same verb.
- are never used as the subject.
- can only act as the object, and only when the person or thing has been used as the subject.
- Ex : `myself`, `yourself`, `himself`, `herself`, `itself`, `oneself`, `ourselves`, `yourselves`, `themselves`

#### Examples:
- I saw `myself` in the mirror.

#### Incorrect examples:
- Myself saw me in the mirror. (I saw `myself` in the mirror)
- Ourselves heard us singing. (We heard `ourselves` singing)


- - -
### Intensive Pronouns
- are used to emphasise the `subject` in a sentence
- are not the `object` of an action
- are very similar to `reflexive pronouns`

#### Examples:
- I made that cake `myself`
- You told me the location `yourself`
- The President `himself` wrote me a letter


- - -
### Demonstrative Pronouns
- are used to replace nouns that are close by (this, these)
- are used to replace nouns that are far away (that, those)
- require context to identify the nouns that they replace

#### Examples:
- I made `this` cake myself.
- You will like `these` cookies.
- `That` is Suzi over there.
- I like `those` houses.


- - -
### Interrogative Pronouns
- are used in questions to replace nouns.
- can be the subject or object in a sentence.
- can be used in direct, indirect or reported questions.
- main ones are who, whom, whose, which, what.

#### Examples:
- `Who` is coming to the party tonight? (direct question)
- Could you tell me `whose` these are? (indirect question)
- She wants to know `which` is correct. (reported question)
- You're wearing `what` to the party? (indirect question, emphasis)

#### Details:
`Who` is used for the `subject` in a sentence
`Whom` is used for the `object` in a sentence
The easy trick is to link `who to he`, and `whom to him`

#### Examples:
- `Who` is coming to the party tonight? (he is coming)
- To `whom` do these shoes belong? (they belong to him)
